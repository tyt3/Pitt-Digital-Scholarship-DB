    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <div>
      The Pitt Digital Scholarship Database will enable users to search for practitioners and advocates of digital scholarship (DS) at the University of Pittsburgh. To make changes to the database, users will be required to sign-up and login so that 1) only those with Pitt domain emails may create accounts and make changes to the database and 2) transactions can be logged and associated with the corresponding user. Users, depending on permission level, can search, view, add, modify, and delete records of people, groups (e.g., organization, school, department, lab), and funding opportunities that support DS. Keywords can be searched by name (people, groups, funding opportunity), methods (e.g., NLP, GIS, 3D scanning), tools (e.g., Python, ArcGIS, SketchUp), or resources (e.g., workstations, 3D printer). Results can be filtered by location (i.e., campus). Time permitting, the app might also provide visualizations (e.g., a network graph or radial chart of the relationships between people, groups, methods, and tools).

    <h2>Purpose and Benefits</h2>
    <div>
      Digital Scholarship (DS) is a broad, complex, and multidisciplinary field; hence, completing DS projects can oftentimes require a wide range of expertise and resources. Though it is an ever-growing field, practitioners and supporters of DS are scattered across the University and, sometimes, in silos. Consequently, scholars pursuing DS projects may have difficulty in identifying and connecting with others to partner with or request assistance/resources. This app will facilitate the aggregation and discovery of DS experts and resources at Pitt.
